        <p style="font-size:120%;">When a web designer is given an end goal like "create a webpage that has this header, this font, these colors, these pictures, and an animated unicorn walking across the screen when users click on this button," the web designer's job is to take that big idea and break it apart into tiny pieces, and then translate these pieces into instructions that the computer can understand -- including putting all these instructions in the correct order or syntax.</p>
        <p style="font-size:120%;">Every page on the web that you visit is built using a sequence of separate instructions, one after another. Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and so on) is a big actor in translating code into something we can see on our screens and even interact with. It can be easy to forget that code without a browser is just a text file -- it's when you put that text file into a browser that the magic happens. When you open a web page, your browser fetches the HTML and other programming languages involved and interprets it.</p>

            <map name="table">
                <area shape="rect" coords="140,120,360,244" href="Table.html">

        <p style="font-size:120%;">HTML and CSS are actually not technically programming languages; they're just page structure and style information. But before moving on to JavaScript and other true languages, you need to know the basics of HTML and CSS, as they are on the front end of every web page and application.</p>
        <p style="font-size:120%;">In the very early 1990s, HTML was the only language available on the web. Web developers had to painstakingly code static sites, page by page. A lot's changed since then: Now there are many computer programming languages available.</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size:110%;">HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.</li>
            <li style="font-size:110%;">CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout.</li>
            <li style="font-size:110%;">JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size:120%;">HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web. </p>
